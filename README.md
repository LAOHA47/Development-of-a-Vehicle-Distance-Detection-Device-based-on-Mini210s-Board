# Development-of-a-Vehicle-Distance-Detection-Device-based-on-Mini210s-Board
Changed the resistance to simulate the distance of the vehicle; converted the current magnitude on the mini210s board into a numerical value representing the distance between vehicles using AD conversion
Programmed the control module of buzzer and LED lights to realize the warning for different vehicle distances, and wrote the corresponding driver program for hardware modules based on Linux
Implemented interactive interface based on QT and web design that can read the resistance value of the resistor of the Mini210s board, display the distance between the vehicles, and control LED lights and the buzzer according to driversâ€™ physical status

Here are demo pitures.
